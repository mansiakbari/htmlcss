        Burj Khalifa 🏡🏠🏙 The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world
        and a global icon. Truly a feat of engineering, the building represents
        the conceptual heart and soul of the city of Dubai. At 828m tall, this
        magnificent structure is located next to The Dubai Mall and has drawn
        visitors from all over the world since opening in 2010. The unmatched
        Burj Khalifa view can be taken in from not one but two observations
        decks the two-storey At the Top on the 124th and 125th floors, as well
        as one of the world’s highest observation decks (555m) on the 148th
        floor.
